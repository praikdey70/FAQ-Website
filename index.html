            <p>No, you do not need to work out every day. In fact, in most cases, I would recommend at least 1-2 days of total rest a week. However, just because you have a rest or recovery day scheduled into your calendar, doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t active at all on these days. Light, regular movement such as walking your dog around the block, or taking time for stretching or foam rolling are great recovery techniques to help increase blood flow and reduce tension in tight muscles. Participating in regular rest days and practicing a well-balanced recovery routine can help you reduce your risk for injury and promote the longevity of your fitness routine.</p>

            <h4>How Can I Increase Lean Muscle Mass?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>Adding heavy strength training into your routine is just one way to increase lean muscle mass. But there are many ways to increase strong lean muscle tone in your body. Any form of resistance that your muscles must fight against that is greater than what they normally experience, can help stimulate the muscle growth process. Completing exercises with your body weight or resistance bands are also effective ways of training to build strength. Start with what you feel most comfortable with and continue building from there. As your exercises or the weight, you’re using start to feel too easy, increase your weight or choose more challenging exercises to continue challenging your muscles and see results.</p>

            <h4>How Much Weight Should I Use When Strength Training?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>When strength training, it’s important to always remember that the workout you’re performing is ‘your workout’. Don’t focus on the number of weight others are using to complete workouts. Instead, focus on your rate of perceived exertion on a scale of 1 to 10. When strength training, you should feel a perceived exertion of 7 to 9, each rep should feel challenging with the last reps and sets feeling significantly harder. If you complete a workout and aren’t feeling challenged, you know it’s time to move up in weight the next time you complete that workout.</p>

            <h4> What Can I Do About Muscle Soreness?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answers">
            <p>When it comes to muscle soreness, a few things will factor in to help you recover your best. First, dialing in your nutrition is key, eating foods to fuel your body and workouts is important as this will give your muscles the nutrients they need for recovery. Rest and plenty of sleep will also play into your recovery as well, as when you’re at a full rest you’re giving your muscles that time they need to repair.

        </div>
        <div class="answers active">
            <p>Your rest will depend on your workout schedule. Like I said previously, I recommend 1 or 2 full days of rest in your schedule. This isn’t only great for giving your body time to recover from your workouts, it also can be a great time for self-care to promote mental health.</p>
